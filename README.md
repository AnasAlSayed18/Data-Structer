# Data Structures in [Programming Language]

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A collection of commonly used data structures implemented in [Programming Language]. This repository includes various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and more. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these data structures work and how they are implemented.

## Introduction

This project provides implementations of various data structures in [Programming Language]. Each data structure is accompanied by explanations and examples to help you understand the underlying concepts. The repository is designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning about data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures Implemented

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Regular, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- Tries
- Others (Bloom Filters, Skip Lists, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired data structure's directory to explore the code and run the examples.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Structures.git
    cd Data-Structures
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:** (if any)

    Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. This may vary depending on the programming language used.

## Usage

Navigate to the directory of the data structure you want to explore, and run the code using the relevant compiler or interpreter. For example, to run a Python example:

```bash
cd linked_list
python linked_list_example.py
