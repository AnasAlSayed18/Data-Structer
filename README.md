## Introduction

This project provides implementations of various data structures in [Programming Language]. Each data structure is accompanied by explanations and examples to help you understand the underlying concepts. The repository is designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning about data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures Implemented

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Regular, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- Tries
